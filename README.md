ECS171 Machine Learning Group14 Group Project

# Description
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/top-10000-spotify-songs-1960-now/code

MachienLearning_SongPopularity is designed to predict a song's popularity based on 
different attributes. We hope this project can help people understand how a song's popularity 
is calculated on Spotify, and hopefully improve a song's popularity based on some of the 
attributes.
